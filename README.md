A small Reddit bot for the Path of Exile community.

1. Install Python

3. Create a reddit app [here](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)
   - Name it
   - Select Script from the radio buttons
   - Short Description
   - Redirect URI (I don't think it matters, I just used google)
   - Create App
4. Set `client_id_string` to value under personal use script in your reddit app
5. Set `client_secret_string` to reddit app secret key
6. Set `account_username` to the reddit bot account name
7. Set `account_password` to the reddit bot account password

__That *should* be everything, but I don't actually remember.__
